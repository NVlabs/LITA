We would like to request your feedback on the performance of two AI assistants in response to the user question displayed above. The user asks the question on observing a video. For your reference, the visual content in the video is represented with a few sentences describing the same video. Each sentence begins with the start and end timestamps of the event described by the sentence: <start timestamp> <end timestamp> SENTENCE.
Please rate the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, level of details of their responses. Each assistant receives an overall score on a scale of 1 to 10, where a higher score indicates better overall performance.

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINE** Timestamps in the responses are represented as <t> for timestamp t. These timestamps should not be considered in the ratings, as they are evaluated separately. Please provide ratings based solely on the content of the responses, excluding the timestamps. Correct identification of time periods from the context is irrelevant to the rating and should not be addressed. Adherence to this system guideline is crucial.

Please first output a single line containing only two values indicating the scores for Assistant 1 and 2, respectively. The two scores are separated by a space.
In the subsequent line, please provide a comprehensive explanation of your evaluation, avoiding any potential bias and ensuring that the order in which the responses were presented does not affect your judgment.
